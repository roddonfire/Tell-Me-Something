# Tell-Me-Something

The goal of our project is to open up all the ESP32 system’s functionality to a web-based interface, ultimately allowing users to control (and even code for) the device from anywhere. Our project will have multiple different components such as the GPS, microphone, ultrasonic sensor, and IMU, and be able obtain different measurements via those components. Then, we will have a server side python script connecting the web interface with the ESP32 and all its sensors. Our end goal in mind is for users to be able to turn their ESP32 device on at home, lets say before they go to work, and then from a remote location make measurements with that device, from work for example. Our device would then give them the power (literally and figuratively) to ask questions such as “what’s the temperature in my home?” or “is the door open?” or even better, “turn on intruder alert” that would activate the microphone and have it detect whether there were footsteps in the home and alert the user if there was. Once we accomplish our goal with these 4 sensors, we (or anyone else, if we make it open source) can add different components to the device and follow the same standards of programming as we used in our original 4 components. The possibilities are endless given all the sensors that are out there, and it will make the stress of worrying about what’s happening in your home go away.
